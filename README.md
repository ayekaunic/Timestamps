# Timestamps
This Python notebook is designed to extract the creation timestamps from JPG files in a specified directory and generate a CSV file containing filenames and their corresponding formatted timestamps.

## Prerequisites
This script utilizes Python libraries that you may need to install if you haven't already:
- Pandas
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Notes:
- This script specifically targets JPEG files (.jpg) within the specified directory.
- If the script encounters errors reading the image files or extracting timestamps, it will gracefully handle these issues and continue processing other files.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements or to handle different image formats.
